<h1>Projects</h1>

<h2>Cypress Script for Automation:</h2>

<ul class="skills">
    <li>In this project I designed multiple automation script for end to end test cases of admin application <br>
        of virus geeks. In all of these, I used BDD approach which is easy for the non-technical person to <br>
        comprehend that what code is actually doing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Building data pipeline with Metatrader 5 and prediction using LSTM:</h2>

<ul class="skills">
    <li>
        In this project, I firstly build data pipeline using Meta Trader 5 API services and made the data <br>
        live coming into the script. After that I applied multiple time series based techniques on data to <br>
        remove noise and trends. After that. LSTM model is designed for the prediction.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Predicting the Next Closing Values of Binance Data:</h2>
<ul class="skills">
    <li>
        In this project I used LSTM as well as Arima model. Before applying that model I preprocessed 
        the data and applied all the Time Series techniques in order to remove noise, seasonality, etc.
        Sentimental Analysis of Tweets
        In that project, I scrapped tweets of the given accounts and did sen timental analysis on them in 
        order to predict the situation that whether the situation was going positive or negative.
    </li>
</ul>
